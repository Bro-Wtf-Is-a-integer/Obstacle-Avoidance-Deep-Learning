# Depth-Only UAV Obstacle Avoidance (Lightweight Real-Time Model)

This project implements a deep learningâ€“based obstacle avoidance system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), using only single-channel depth images to predict navigation actions in real time. The model is designed to run efficiently on resource-constrained platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Depth-only input (no RGB or external localization)
- Lightweight architecture (~696 KB)
- Real-time inference (~17.7 ms per frame) using TP4 on Google Colab
- Temporal modeling using GRU
- Attention-based pooling mechanism
- Trained and validated in CoppeliaSim
- Real-world testing with Intel RealSense D435

## Model Architecture

- **Spatial Encoder**: Depthwise-Separable Convolutions + GroupNorm
- **Feature Extractor**: Additional convolutional layers with max pooling
- **SPP**: 2Ã—2 Spatial Pyramid Pooling
- **Temporal Modeling**: GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- **Attention**: Simple linear attention layer
- **Classifier**: Fully connected output layer for 9 navigation classes
